# El Farol Bar Problem ‚Äî Cognitive Models and Analysis

This repository contains code and data for a comprehensive experimental and computational analysis of the **El Farol Bar Problem**, a classical coordination dilemma in game theory and behavioral economics.

The project includes:

- Statistical analysis of human behavior from experimental data
- Implementation of cognitive models simulating agent behavior
- Model fitting and comparison against human data

## üìä Overview

The El Farol Bar Problem serves as a framework for exploring decision-making under limited coordination. This project investigates how individuals learn and adapt in such settings by modeling their behavior using various cognitive strategies and comparing these models to experimental outcomes.

The repository includes data, simulation code, and model fitting routines to answer key questions about coordination, adaptation, and cognitive modeling.
